# AI Marketing System

The ai_marketing_system is a multi-modal AI content generation engine designed to streamline digital marketing workflows by processing a single product brief to simultaneously generate platform-optimized copywriting, SEO metadata, and complementary visual assets. Under the hood, it leverages a decoupled, highly scalable architecture combining a modern React frontend with a high-performance Python FastAPI backend. To ensure a seamless user experience without server timeouts, long-running AI API calls are intelligently offloaded to an asynchronous Celery and Redis task queue. Ultimately, this tool acts as a digital force multiplier, drastically reducing campaign creation time while maintaining consistent, multi-platform brand messaging.

## 📅 Week 1 — Foundation & API Integration

During Week 1, our main goal was to lay a strong foundation.
* Established the backend infrastructure, secured our API keys, and initialized the Redis database.
* Developed the Python services needed to connect with external AI text and image generation models.
* Refined prompt instructions to ensure the generated visual assets match the tone of the marketing copy.

---

## 📅 Week 2 — Async Queue & Stability

During Week 2, our focus shifted to making the system smooth and crash-proof.
* Set up Redis and a background worker to help the system run smoothly and handle more work.
* Updated the system to instantly give a ticket number while heavy AI tasks run in the background.
* Added a new feature to easily check the ticket status to see when the work is finished.
